					<article><p><p>
	Investments in foreign securities may be subject to increased volatility as the value of these securities can change more rapidly and extremely than can the value of U.S. securities. Foreign securities are subject to increased issuer risk because foreign issuers may not experience the same degree of regulation as U.S. issuers do and are held to different reporting, accounting, and auditing standards. In addition, foreign securities are subject to increased costs because there are generally higher commission rates on transactions, transfer taxes, higher custodial costs, and the potential for foreign tax charges on dividend and interest payments. Many foreign markets are relatively small, and securities issued in less-developed countries face the risks of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, and adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, including suspension of the ability to transfer currency from a country. Economic, political, social, or diplomatic developments can also negatively impact performance.</p>

	&nbsp;Refers to either small companies or mutual funds which hold the stock of small companies. Small-caps have higher volatility as well as higher potential for greater capital gains. The illiquidity of the small-cap market may adversely affect the value of these investments so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Many small-cap funds come under the heading of an aggressive growth mutual fund. Refer to the fund&#39;s prospectus for complete information on risks, fees and expenses.</p>
<p>
	Morningstar<sup>&reg; </sup>defines this as: Concentrating assets in small-capitalization stocks may subject the portfolio to the risk that those stocks underperform other capitalizations or the market as a whole. Smaller, less-seasoned companies may be subject to increased liquidity risk compared with mid- and large-cap companies and may experience greater price volatility than do those securities because of limited product lines, management experience, market share, or financial resources, among other factors.<br />

					<article><p><p>
	A change of asset value may occur because of inflation or deflation, causing the portfolio to underperform. Inflation may cause the present value of future payments to decrease, causing a decline in the future value of assets or income. Deflation causes prices to decline throughout the economy over time, impacting issuers&#39; creditworthiness and increasing their risk for default, which may reduce the value of the portfolio.</p>

	A creditor&#39;s claim against property. For example, a mortgage is a lien against a house; if the mortgage is not paid on time, the house can be seized to satisfy the lien. Similarly, a bond is a lien against a company&#39;s assets; if interest and principal are not paid when due, the assets may be seized to pay the bondholders. As soon as a debt is paid, the lien is removed. Liens may be granted by courts to satisfy judgments.</p>

					<header>Life expectancy</header>
					<article><p><p>
	The age an average person is expected to live, as calculated by an actuary. Insurance companies base their projections of benefit payouts on actuarial studies of such factors as sex, heredity and health habits and base their rates on actuarial analysis. Life expectancy can be calculated at birth or at some other age and generally varies according to age. Thus, all persons at birth might have an average life expectancy of 70 years and all persons aged 40 years might have an average life expectancy of 75 years. Life expectancy projections determine such matters as the ages when an individual may start and finish withdrawing funds from an Individual Retirement Account. Annuities payable for lifetimes are usually based on separate male or female tables, except that a qualified plan or trust must use unisex tables.</p>

	An organization made up of a general partner, who manages a project and limited partners, who invest money but have limited liability, are not involved in day-to-day management and usually cannot lose more than their capital contribution. Usually limited partners receive income, capital gains and tax benefits; the general partner collects fees and a percentage of capital gains and income. Typical limited partnerships are in real estate, oil and gas and equipment leasing, but they also finance movies, research and development and other projects. Typically, public limited partnerships are sold through brokerage firms, for minimum investments of $5,000, whereas private limited partnerships are put together with fewer than 35 limited partners who invest more than $20,000 each.</p>

	The unit value (accumulation unit or annuity unit) is a standard measurement for exchange. The &quot;unit&quot; is used to calculate the contract value on the variable portion of a variable annuity or life contract. For example, if you own 100 units of a given fund (or subaccount) and the unit value of each unit is $2.35, your account value for that fund would be $235. If the unit value increases to $3, the value of your account is $300. It is important to note that the number of units does not change; you still own 100 units. The account value equals the unit value x the number of units owned.</p>
